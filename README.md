## Overview
This tutorial aims to demonstrate a simple way to use NLTK's VADER tool to detect sentiment in text. This tutorial uses pandas, regex, NLTK, and string to compile a sentiment analysis list for each candidate mentioned in the dataset. Tutees will also learn to clean up data to be processed through the analyzer.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this tutorial is linked here: (https://github.com/favstats/demdebates2020/blob/master/data/debates.csv). Please note that this dataset is not attached to this repository, and you will need to download it to your machine or use **wget** in your terminal to use the dataset.

## Jupyter Notebook
There is a Jupyter Notebook associated with the tutorial and can be found in this repository under the name **NLTKTutorial.ipynb**. This notebook contains the entire Python script, as well as installation prompts for NLTK, pandas, and the dataset using **wget**.
