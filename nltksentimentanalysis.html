            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p> Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, is a Python library configured to analyze natural speech data. NLTK offers a wide range of features that can easily process any body of text, such as part-of-speech tagging, tokenization, and semantic reasoning. 
                One of NLTK's most popular features is its sentiment analysis tool, VADER. VADER, also known as <b>Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning</b>, uses its sentiment lexicon and a blend of grammatical rules and syntactical conventions.</p>

            <h2>How does VADER work?</h2>
            <h3>Sentiment Lexicon</h3>
                <p>A sentiment lexicon is a dictionary that maps words, phrases, and symbols and matches those to a specific emotional valence. VADER's literature further explains this process:</p>
                <blockquote> "We  begin  by  constructing  a  list  inspired  by  examiningexisting well-established  sentiment  word-banks  (LIWC, ANEW, and  GI).  To  this,  we  next  incorporate  numerous lexical  features  common  to  sentiment  expression  
                    in  mi-croblogs, including a full list of Western-style  emoticons (for example, “:-)” denotes a “smiley face” and generally indicates  positive  sentiment),  sentiment-related  acronyms and  initialisms (e.g.,  LOL  and  WTF  are  both  
                    sentiment-laden  initialisms),  and  commonly  used  slang12  with  senti-ment value (e.g., “nah”, “meh   ”and “giggly”). This processprovided us with over 9,000 lexical feature candidates. Next,  we  assessed  the  general  applicability  
                    of  each  feature  candidate  to  sentiment  expressions.  We  used  a  wisdom-of-the-crowd  (WotC)  approach  (Surowiecki,  2004) to  acquire  a  valid  point  estimate  for  the  sentiment  valence (intensity)  of  each  context-free  
                    candidate  feature.  We  collected  intensity  ratings  on  each  of  our  candidate  lexical features  from  ten  independent  human  raters  (for  a  total  of 90,000+ ratings). Features were rated on a scale from '[–4] Extremely Negative' 
                    to '[4] Extremely Positive', with allowance for '[0] Neutral (or Neither, N/A)'" (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014). </blockquote>

                <h2>Step 0: Installing and Importing Modules</h2>
                <p>For step zero, you will need to start by installing and importing the necessary modules. For this particular analysis, you will need to download the following modules onto your terminal.</p>
                <pre><code>
                    pip install pandas
                    pip install nltk
                    # this code will download all of the necessary 
                    python3 -c "import nltk; [nltk.download(x) for x in ['vader_lexicon', 'stopwords', 'punkt', 'wordnet', 'omw-1.4']]"
                </pre></code>
                <p> Once you download those, you will need to also download our dataset from GitHub. You can do this directly in your terminal like this:</p>
                <pre><code> 
                wget https://github.com/favstats/demdebates2020/blob/master/data/debates.csv
                </code></pre>
                <p> Once everything is downloaded correctly, you are ready to head to step 1.</p>
